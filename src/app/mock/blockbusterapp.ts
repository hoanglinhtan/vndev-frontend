            with the family too as their adopted daughter. However, Spider (Jack
            Champion) – a human child left on Pandora who hung out with the
            Sully family – is taken by Quaritch, who it's revealed is his
            father.

            The Sully family make their way to the home of the Metkayina clan,
            led by Tonowari (Cliff Curtis) and Ronal (Kate Winslet). Jake
            invokes "Uturu", a Na'vi tradition that grants any refugee seeking
            sanctuary safe harbour, and they start to learn the customs and
            traditions of the water clan.

            Quaritch discovers that the Metkayina have a close bond with the

            they gear up for war.

            Even if Jake wants to avoid the conflict, he's left with no choice

            Before that can happen, outcast tulkun Payakan – who had formed a
            close bond with Lo'ak – attacks the RDA's ship in revenge for the
            RDA killing its mother. So begins an epic sea battle between the RDA
            and Jake, Neytiri and the Metkayina people that leads to Neteyam
            being fatally shot.
          </p>
          <p>
            Jake and Neytiri manage to rescue Lo'ak, but Kiri and Tuk are still
            on board the ship that is now sinking as a result of the battle.
            They infiltrate the ship and Neytiti takes Spider hostage and
            threatens his life, backing that Quaritch feels enough for his son
            to let her daughters go.
          </p>
          <p>
            It works, barely, but Jake knows that Quaritch will stop at nothing
            to hunt him down, so a brutal battle ensues. Long story short, Jake
            leaves Quaritch for dead and the remaining Sullys just about manage
            to escape the ship before it fully sinks.
          </p>
          <p>
            What they don't know is that Spider rescues Quaritch and takes him
            to safety, but he chooses not to stay with his father and heads back
            to reunite with the Sully family. Quite what Spider thinks about
            Neytiri threatening his life remains to be seen, and could play out
            in the third movie.
          </p>
          <p>
            Jake tells Tonowari and Ronal that he'll take his family elsewhere
            to stop the Metkayina being threatened by the RDA. However, they
            refuse and say that the Sullys are now part of their clan,
            especially since they buried Neteyam there.
          </p>
          <p>
            "We are sea people now, this is our home," Jake says in the closing
            voiceover. "I can't save my family by running... This is our
            fortress, this is where we make our stand."
          </p>
          <p>
            It certainly appears to be setting up an all-out war with Quaritch
            and the RDA in the third movie. However, Cameron leaves other
            mysteries unsolved that could prove critical, such as who Kiri's
            father is and what her mysterious connection to Eywa is. (To read

            If the sequel has proved anything though, Cameron won't always give

        <strong>
          <span>Plot Synopsis</span>
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Since the release of Inception in 2010, Christopher Nolan has posed
        one of the most intriguing questions to all psychological thriller
        fans. And so we set out to answer the infamous ending of Inception:
        Is the top still spinning?
      </p>
      <p>
        Inception is about Cobb, a man who invades people’s dreams and
        extracts valuable information using a dream-sharing device. It isn’t
        long before he is asked to implant information rather than steal it
        by a businessman named Saito.
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite the unusual subject material, Christopher Nolan was able to
        craft a story that’s both intellectually stimulating and thought
        provoking. The phrase “dream inside a dream inside a dream” became
        popular among geeks, and word spread about the complicated nature of
        the entire movie.
      </p>
      <p>
        The fastest at decoding the subtle complexities of the storyline
        were regarded with awe. Ever since, Nolan had grown to be somewhat
        of a living legend.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dom Cobb tosses his spinning top to see if he’s dreaming or awake –
        if it spins, he’s still dreaming; if it falls, he’s awake. The movie
        abruptly ends when Cobb spins his top to learn of reality, and the
        focus shifts to his children, whom he approaches to greet while
        still unaware of the outcome. What does this mean and what should
        you know?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>
          <span>How did Mal end up being part of the dream world?</span>
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Before Mal passed away, Cobb and Mal were married and conducting a
        dream investigation together. Cobb was compelled to use his
        understanding of dreams to commit theft after she passed away.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>
          <span>How do the endless stairways function?</span>
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        The never-ending stairways are paradoxes, or logical fallacies since
        they are unrealistic in practical terms. Arthur is the dreamer in
        the level in which he seems to be using the stairway, even though
        Ariadne likely designed the tiers and the stairway.
      </p>
      <p>
        Eams prepared a similar set of shortcuts before the snow dream. When
        they require a quicker route towards the fortress, Cobb is made
        aware about them by Ariadne.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span>
          <strong>
            What affects the Hotel Dream’s lack of gravitational pull?
          </strong>
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        The dreamer may experience effects from events occurring outside the
        dream, just like everyday life. People occasionally dream of
        glaciers and ice caps if it’s chilly while they are asleep.
        Sometimes when someone gets out of bed, they will dream about
        slipping or skydiving.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a result, once the vehicle in the higher dream level crashes off
        the bridge, the movements of the people inside are disrupted, and
        that sense of falling bleeds into the dream, giving the illusion
        that there is no gravitational pull in the hotel level underneath
        the vehicle.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nevertheless, this effect only appears to go up one level inside a
        dream.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>
          <span>Is Cobb still dreaming at the end of Inception?</span>{' '}
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        One minute in the actual world equals 40 hours in the dream world,
        according to a theory suggested by Reddit user ‘routlinemagic.’
        According to this logic, if Cobb’s wife Mal was right about being in
        a dream, she would have awoken in the real world and attempted to
        wake Leonardo’s character as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a result, following Mal’s suicide, Leonardo’s character would not
        have to spend the next year and a half in the dream. Finally, the
        idea proposes that Leonardo’s character has no recollection of the
        last time he saw his children, meaning that he has been isolated
        from them for more than a year and a half and that Mal has died.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another perspective is that Inception is about a father attempting
        to come home to his children. In truth, the scene’s underlying
        meaning, as we read it, is that Cobb is still dreaming, and his
        dreams are his new home in the last scene.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ken Watanabe’s Saito recruits him for a task that is a big exercise
        in catharsis for his jaded psyche, allowing him to use his labor and
        skills to create an ideal reality for himself. Cobb’s fantasy
        reality has repaired his marital problems by the end of the Saito
        job, and he finds his way home at the end of the movie. The trick is
        that this “home” is kept in his mind, similar to how he has saved
        other memories.

            What does Cobb’s totem have to say to us? Is it all a nightmare?
            Is reality even relevant?

        Perhaps the point is that a straightforward answer does not exist.
        Finding meaning for oneself, on the other hand, is a pleasant
        experience.

        One would assume that this was definitely done on purpose to make
        the ending nearly unanswerable because Nolan doesn’t care if Cobb is
        dreaming or not. “I skip out of the back of the theatre before
        anyone catches me, and the audience has a really strong reaction:
        generally a groan”, he continued. The point is that it matters to
        the audience in absolute terms, even if it’s fiction, a kind of
        virtual reality when you’re watching.

        Framing the question to focus on why it counts rather than the
        solution itself appears to be something only Nolan could accomplish,
        and it’s a clever strategy. Everyone has their own perception, and
        knowing you’re neither right nor wrong is reassuring. “I like to
        believe that Cobb gets back to his kids since I have young
        kids”,&nbsp; the director added in an interview a few years ago.
        “People who have children read it in a very different way than
        someone who does not. The audience contributes a lot to it,” he
        concluded.

        As the writer Philip Pullman said, “The meaning of a story emerges
        in the meeting between the words on the page and the thoughts in the
        reader’s mind”.

        This isn’t to say that anything is allowed. Context, convention,
        older stories, and previous usage all contribute to meaning. But
        it’s up to us to interpret what we read and create an argument for
        why we’re doing things the way we’re doing them.
